# HBPO
Holistic Building Performance Ontology (HBPO) is designed to be unified and generalized building performance ontology as a comprehensive knowledge repository that bridges the gap between building information and performance models and embodies form, function, and behavior.

HBPO focuses on acoustic, lighting, and energy domains as subsets to represent a range of sufficiently different domains. It encompasses essential data, relationships, and information requirements within and across these domains.  

## Reference Publication
Reference to the __*"An Ontology for Holistic Building Performance Modeling And Analysis"*__ paper TBD.

The authors of this study are Duygu Utkucu and Rafael Sacks, from Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

## Development of Ontology
The HBPO was encoded in OWL and developed using Protégé. It consists of 28 classes, 26 object properties, 183 data properties, and 1,121 axioms. The consistency of the ontology was verified using the HermiT reasoner in Protégé. 

## Evaluation of Ontology
The HBPO's feasibility and applicability were evaluated through acoustic, lighting, and energy analysis experiments conducted on a case study BIM model. These experiments leveraged the Holistic Building Performance (HBP) meta-graph aligned with the HBPO framework.
